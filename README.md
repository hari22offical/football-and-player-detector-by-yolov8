 <p><b>↪ COMPUTER VISION</b></p>
    <p>Computer vision is one of the fields of artificial intelligence that trains and enables computers to understand the visual world. Computers can use digital images and deep learning models to accurately identify and classify objects and react to them.

Computer vision in AI is dedicated to the development of automated systems that can interpret visual data (such as photographs or motion pictures) in the same manner as people do. The idea behind computer vision is to instruct computers to interpret and comprehend images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This is the foundation of the computer vision field. Regarding the technical side of things, computers will seek to extract visual data, manage it, and analyze the outcomes using sophisticated software programs.

The amount of data that we generate today is tremendous - 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. This growth in data has proven to be one of the driving factors behind the growth of computer vision.</p>

<p><b>↪ OBJECTION DETECTION </b></p>
    <p>What is object detection?
Object detection is a computer vision technique that works to identify and locate objects within an image or video. Specifically, object detection draws bounding boxes around these detected objects, which allow us to locate where said objects are in (or how they move through) a given scene.

Object detection is commonly confused with image recognition, so before we proceed, it’s important that we clarify the distinctions between them.

Image recognition assigns a label to an image. A picture of a dog receives the label “dog”. A picture of two dogs, still receives the label “dog”. Object detection, on the other hand, draws a box around each dog and labels the box “dog”. The model predicts where each object is and what label should be applied. In that way, object detection provides more information about an image than recognition.

Here’s an example of how this distinction looks in practice:

<p><b>↪ YOLO V8</b></p>
    <p>What is YOLOv8?
YOLOv8 is the latest iteration of the YOLO family of models. YOLO stands for You Only Look Once and these series of models are thus named because of their ability to predict every object present in an image with one forward pass. 
The main distinction introduced by the YOLO models was the framing of the task at hand. The authors of the paper reframed the object detection task as a regression problem (predict the bounding box coordinates) instead of classification. 
YOLO models are pre-trained on huge datasets such as COCO and ImageNet. This gives them the simultaneous ability to be the Master and the Student. They provide highly accurate predictions on classes they are pre-trained on (master ability) and can also learn new classes comparatively easily (student ability).

YOLO models are also faster to train and have the ability to produce high accuracy with smaller model sizes. They can be trained on single GPUs, making them more accessible to developers like us. 
YOLOv8 is the latest iteration of these YOLO models (as of early 2023). It has undergone a few major changes from its ancestors, such as anchor free detection, the introduction of C3 convolutions, and mosaic augmentation.
